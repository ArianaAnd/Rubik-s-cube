# Rubik-s-cube
OpenGL project C++
Algorithm:

STEP 1: Define nodes for 27 cubes that are used to compose an entire cube known as a "Rubik's cube".

STEP 2: Define the colors for each cube of the Rubik's cube to distinguish one cube from the other and also the color of the speedometer, which is used to control the rotation speed. 

Output():STEP 3: This function is used to display the message using the glutBitmapCharacter () and glRasterpos * () commands.

STEP 5: The tops of the face maps. This is the use of the colorcube function made 27 times with different prefixes for all 27 cubes including one without color, 6 with one color, 12 with two colors and 8 with three colors on it.

Speedmeter () function: STEP 6: This function is used to define peaks for a speedometer, which is used to control the speed of rotation.
